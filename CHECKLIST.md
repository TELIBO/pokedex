- [ ] Understand how useEffect works with dependencies
- [ ] Know how props are passed to child components
- [ ] Understand the API fetch logic and Promise.all()

### 3. Prepare Your Story
- [ ] Why did you build this project?
- [ ] What did you learn?
- [ ] What challenges did you face?
- [ ] What would you improve?

### 4. Technical Preparation
- [ ] Review React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- [ ] Understand component lifecycle
- [ ] Know the difference between props and state
- [ ] Understand async/await and promises

### 5. Demo Preparation
- [ ] Practice explaining the project in 1 minute

## During the Interview

### Opening (30 seconds)
"I built a Pokédex application using React.js. It allows users to browse over 649 Pokemon from 5 different regions, search by name, and view detailed information. The app fetches real-time data from the PokéAPI and demonstrates core React concepts like components, hooks, and state management."

### Demo (2 minutes)
1. Show the landing page (Kanto region loaded)
2. Click on a Pokemon to show details
3. Use search to find a specific Pokemon
4. Switch between regions
5. Show responsive design (resize window if doing screen share)

### Code Walkthrough (2 minutes)
1. Open App.js - explain it's the parent component
2. Point out useState hooks and what they do
3. Point out useEffect and explain when it runs
4. Show one child component and explain props
5. Show the API fetch function

### Questions to Ask Interviewer
- "What technologies does your team use?"
- "Are there opportunities to work on React projects?"
- "What's the learning culture like for junior developers?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Don't memorize answers - understand concepts  
❌ Don't say "it just works" - explain HOW it works  
❌ Don't claim you know everything  
❌ Don't bad-mouth any technology  
❌ Don't skip error handling explanations  

✅ Do speak clearly and confidently  
✅ Do admit when you don't know something  
✅ Do show enthusiasm for learning  
✅ Do ask clarifying questions  
✅ Do relate concepts to real-world usage

## Emergency Questions (If You Get Stuck)

**Q: "Explain the Virtual DOM"**
A: "It's a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the real DOM, and only updates what changed. This makes React fast."

**Q: "What's the difference between state and props?"**
A: "State is data managed within a component and can change. Props are data passed from parent to child and are read-only in the child."

**Q: "Why use React over vanilla JavaScript?"**
A: "React provides component reusability, easier state management, better performance with Virtual DOM, and a large ecosystem of tools and libraries."

**Q: "What are hooks?"**
A: "Functions that let you use React features in functional components. useState manages state, useEffect handles side effects like API calls."
